# Did Early Termination of SNAP Emergency Allotments Increase Food Scarcity in the US?

This research project examines whether U.S. states that ended Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Emergency Allotments (EA) early during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced greater increases in food scarcity compared to those that maintained EA until the federal cutoff in 2023.

Using a staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach and state-level data from the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey and USDA, we assessed the causal impact of EA expiration on food scarcity. While food scarcity declined nationwide over time, our analysis found only minimal differences between early-terminating and late-terminating states, likely due to overlapping federal relief programs and data limitations.

This project contributes to the policy debate on federal nutrition assistance by highlighting the importance of contextual economic conditions and the need for robust data collection to evaluate emergency interventions effectively.
